[length: 03:43.086]
[00:01.634] You and me stuck on the ocean now
[00:04.159] Nothing but waves, and they're spilling in
[00:06.772] I wanna dry up but you
[00:09.300] Just keep on going, don't you?
[00:11.658] I don't even know how we got here
[00:14.130] All my reasoning have disappeared
[00:16.681] I wanna bury the hatchet
[00:19.324] And find the way back to our home
[00:21.992] Our home, our home
[00:24.604] We don't have to drift inside this dome
[00:31.526] I will not let us fade away
[00:34.102] It's not a price I wanna pay
[00:36.728] And it's not too late
[00:39.733] I know we lost our purpose
[00:42.310] Chasing all that surplus
[00:44.628] You are all that I need
[00:47.150] I feel that we can break free
[00:49.671] We can still go back there
[00:52.277] To a place with no cares
[00:54.759] We can turn this ship around
[00:57.233] We can turn this ship around
[00:59.742] All the way back home
[01:01.709] Chasing all that we do not dare
[01:04.140] Chasing all that we don't have
[01:06.667] Chasing all that we do not dare, we do not
[01:09.994] All the way back home
[01:11.749] Chasing all that we do not dare
[01:14.151] Chasing all that we don't have
[01:16.634] Chasing all that we do not dare, we do not
[01:21.690] Yesterday we could be ourselves
[01:24.248] Didn't have much but nevertheless
[01:26.876] We were true to each other
[01:29.332] But now we don't even bother
[01:31.626] I remember you being hopeful
[01:34.194] But the tall waves have worn us down
[01:36.836] And slowly we are drowning
[01:39.369] That's why you need to come with me, with me, with me
[01:44.475] Turn around one eighty degrees
[01:46.924] And cross this sea
[01:51.433] I will not let us fade away
[01:53.973] It's not a price l wanna pay
[01:56.625] And it's not too late
[01:59.514] I know we lost our purpose
[02:02.249] Chasing all that surplus
[02:04.727] You are all that I need
[02:07.160] I feel that we can break free
[02:09.684] We can still go back there
[02:12.310] To a place with no cares
[02:14.860] We can turn this ship around
[02:17.144] We can turn this ship around
[02:19.696] All the way back home
[02:21.686] Chasing all that we do not dare
[02:24.072] Chasing all that we don't have
[02:26.639] Chasing all that we do not dare, we do not
[02:29.895] All the way back home
[02:31.744] Chasing all that we do not dare
[02:34.074] Chasing all that we don't have
[02:36.512] Chasing all that we do not dare, we do not
[02:41.265] l always knew we could do so many great things
[02:46.800] So believe in me
[02:49.373] I believe in you
[02:51.336] And I just feel that this will be an upswing
[02:56.670] So hear me out
[02:59.507] I know we lost our purpose
[03:02.270] Chasing all that surplus
[03:04.703] You are all that I need
[03:07.069] I feel that we can break free
[03:09.662] We can still go back there
[03:12.070] To a place with no cares
[03:14.792] We can turn this ship around
[03:17.140] We can turn this ship around
[03:19.602] All the way back home (oh-oh-oh-oh)
[03:21.669] Chasing all that we do not dare
[03:24.050] Chasing all that we don't have
[03:26.502] Chasing all that we do not dare, we do not
[03:29.696] All the way back home
[03:31.575] Chasing all that we do not dare
[03:34.132] Chasing all that we don't have
[03:36.625] Chasing all that we do not dare
[03:38.546] All the way back home

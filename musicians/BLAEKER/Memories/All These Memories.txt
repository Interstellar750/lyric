The sun is going down now

Been at it for a while

And I have had enough of this

I doubt that we can solve it

Been tryin' for so long

And I just can't ignore

That it won't

Ever be the same

No we will never be that good again

Don't drag it out

Skip the innocence

Things will never be the same again

You know, I got all that I need

No need to apologise

No we won't waste any more time, yeah

I am all that I need

No need to apologise

No we won't waste any more time, yeah

You're still stuck on my mind

You won't go away, it's like you are a part of me

The mansion in my dreams

Now you won't be there

And I just can't ignore

That it won't

Ever be the same

No we will never be that good again

Don't drag it out

Skip the innocence

Things will never be the same again 

You know, I got all that I need 

No need to apologise 

No we won't waste any more time, yeah 

I am all that I need

No need to apologise 

No we won't waste any more time, yeah 


All these memories that we've made

Won't fade away from a while
You say you don't mind
That you'll be just fine
No room for a second chance
I am all that I need
No need to apologise
We won't waste any more time, yeah
I am all that I need
No need to apologise
I am all that I need
No need to apologise
No we won't waste any more time, yeah
I am all that I need
No need to apologise
No we won't waste any more time, yeah
Baby yeah
I got all you need
I got all you need, say it
We won't waste any more time, yeah

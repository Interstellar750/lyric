[00:01.579] I don't want to save you
[00:03.527] Don't want to be strangers
[00:05.312] Let me feel like you know what to do
[00:09.047] Leave your limitations
[00:10.942] Live and go against them
[00:12.616] Just go and starting something new
[00:16.295] Cause I know I know I know
[00:17.964] That what you planned out
[00:19.447] Everything that you built up
[00:21.303] Isn't what you want
[00:23.777] And I know I know I know
[00:25.405] The life you're living
[00:26.841] Isn't that fulfilling
[00:28.732] Let me help you out
[00:31.839] Lay your love on me
[00:34.479] leave your head and
[00:35.399] Let you mind be free
[00:38.202] Save yourself and
[00:39.042] leave the words you've spoken
[00:42.544] Cause some dreams are meant to be broken
[00:46.631] Lay your love on me
[00:49.366] leave your head and
[00:50.245] Let you mind be free
[00:53.073] Save yourself and
[00:54.014] leave the words you've spoken
[00:57.491] Cause some dreams are meant to be broken
[01:16.741] Tear down all your visions
[01:18.430] Go against the feeling
[01:20.253] Make them fall like gravel to the floor
[01:24.062] Only when the dust sets
[01:25.783] You will start to regret
[01:27.780] All the things that you've been fighting for
[01:31.358] Cause I know and I know and I know
[01:32.812] That what you planned out
[01:34.378] Everything that you build up
[01:36.320] Isn't what you want
[01:38.805] And I know and I know
[01:40.366] The life you're living
[01:41.808] Isn't that fulfilling
[01:43.653] Let me help you out
[01:46.563] Lay your love on me
[01:49.372] Leave your head and let your mind be free
[01:53.111] Save yourself and leave the words you've spoken
[01:57.251] Cause some dreams are meant to be broken
[02:01.611] Lay your love on me
[02:04.222] Leave your head and let your mind be free

[02:31.686] Lay your love on me
[02:34.430] Leave your head and let your mind be free
[02:38.091] Save yourself and leave the words you've spoken
[02:42.353] Cause some dreams are meant to be broken

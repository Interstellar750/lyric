[length: 02:55.909]
[00:07.665] A new place a new home for a while
[00:10.778] Let me feel alive
[00:15.741] Nothing to hold me back, take my time
[00:18.983] just enjoy the ride
[00:24.099] A nomad passing by life is good
[00:27.226] Best I've ever felt.
[00:32.415] Get me up, somewhere new
[00:34.269] Somewhere I can find myself
[00:40.730] Oh I feel I feel I feel I feel so alive
[00:48.803] As I reach out, reach out, reach out, reach out to the sky
[00:56.957] I've found my way
[00:58.934] I've found my way
[01:01.642] I was in the dark
[01:02.654] Against it all
[01:03.766] But made it through the day
[01:05.166] Cause I've found my way
[01:07.406] I've found my way
[01:09.945] In my bad times I know I'll be ok
[01:13.373] Cause I've found my way
[01:21.756] Cause I've found my way
[01:30.047] Cause I've found my way
[01:31.323] My way, My way way-way-way
[01:34.460] Found my way
[01:35.879] My way
[01:38.357] Cause I've found my way
[01:39.786] My way, My way way-way-way
[01:42.618] Found my way
[01:43.993] My way
[01:46.567] I've found my way
[01:48.644] I've found my way
[01:51.203] I was in the dark
[01:52.276] Against it all
[01:53.376] But made it through the day
[01:54.850] Cause I've found my way
[01:56.979] I've found my way
[01:59.571] In my bad times I know I'll be ok
[02:03.109] Cause I've found my way
[02:11.331] Cause I've found my way
[02:19.558] Cause I've found my way
[02:21.096] My way, My way way-way-way
[02:23.968] Found my way
[02:25.374] My way
[02:28.026] Cause I've found my way
[02:29.443] My way, My way way-way-way
[02:32.262] Found my way
[02:33.522] My way
[02:36.199] I've found my way (I've found my way)
[02:38.379] I've found my way
[02:40.859] I was in the dark
[02:41.979] Against it all
[02:43.159] But made it through the day
[02:44.472] Cause I've found my way (I've found...)
[02:46.778] I've found my way (I've found my way...)
[02:49.253] In my bad times I know I'll be ok
[02:52.641] Cause I've found my way

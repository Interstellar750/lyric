Wake up
Baby, all the stars are shining bright
Yeah, we should stay up
So that we can look at them all night
Just keep holding me
Don't let me go
Everything's so magical
All I need is you tonight
If I shut mey eyes
keeping them closed
All other senses explode
You and me under the sky
Let's stay up all night
Give our hearts a new beginning
When I fell in love
Every second, every minute
We were high on life
Didn't waste our time
Didn't sleep as much now
Let's stay up all night
Go on
Baby, let me hear what's on your mind
Yeah, let's talk
You have my attention tonight
